<p>9/16/2022 - This week we made tons of progress for our Rube Goldberg Machine, on Friday we also had a challenge day where we tried to make a boat out of paper to see if it could float in water</p>
<p>9/23/2022 - This week we finished our Rube Goldberg machines and got them tested our Rube Goldberg machine had a slope, a trap door, a pulley, and a see saw with a needle at the end that pops the baloon.Our project ended up being probably the most complex in the class which was cool. Overall I think that this was the best project so far.</p>
